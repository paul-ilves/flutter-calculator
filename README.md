# Flutter Calculator

This is a sample Flutter project I made to show my students and co-workers on how you can efficiently design Flutter apps, the basics of stylong in Flutter as well as some logical patterns on how to create a real-life calculator (which is not as trivial as it may seem). As of now it performs all the required arithmetical operations such as addition, substraction, division, multiplication, modul and more!

# Credits

I used the dark-themed design from Dribbble.com by Lucia Scott for inspiration. 


# Deployment

Deployment is as straight-forward as with any other Flutter app! Just open it with the IDE of your choice (I personally prefer IntelliJ IDEA) and deploy it to your physical device or emulator. Note that you can deploy it to an iOS device only if you use a Mac!
